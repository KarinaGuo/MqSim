## Input parameters for high MR pressure sites


  ## Population parameters
population_size = 1000
population_carrying_capacity = population_size*5 # If population creeps above this value, comp is used to punish the population size by increasing the minimum probability of death based on how much higher population size is than the carrying capacity
population_minimum_size = population_size/10 # If population falls below this value, there is a 10x increased chance of recruitment
MR_mean = 0.787 # From actual genotype data 
MR_sd = 0.385
disturbance_impact_val=5 # impacts base age & MR death factor and recruitment constant

### Genotype pred
#> prediction_rmnoNA %>% group_by(Disease_pressure) %>% summarise(mean_pred = mean(Prediction), sd_pred = sd(Prediction))

  ## Parameters

  ## Mortality parameters
age_impact = 1.0 # scaled age inflicted increase - from 0 to 1, should add to 1 with MR impact val
mortality_age_shift = 150 # at what age does increases in age increase chance of death

MR_imp = T # toggle on/off for MR inflicted death increase
MR_death_impact = 0.5 # linear scaled MR inflicted death increase - from 0 to 1, should add to 1 with age impact val
MR_age_impact = 20 # scaled impact of age (ages / MR_age_impact_val) on MR inflicted death increase

MR_recruit_imp = F# toggle on/off of MR affect on recruitment
MR_recruit_impact = 0.5 # impact of MR on recruitment, a multiplier of the individual MR to reduce recruitment chance
MR_lateintro = T
MR_timepoint = 1000 # time point when MR is introduced

comp_imp = T # toggle on/off for competition due to carrying capacity 
comp_impact = 0.9 # impact of competition due to carrying capacity (1.x multiplier of a scaled competition influence)

  ## Recruitment parameterss
recruitment_const = 0.003 # base constant for chance of recruitment
recruitment_age = 7 # age to begin recruiting
recruitment_mean = 100 # mean for PDF of normal distribution for number of recruited individuals
recruitment_sd = recruitment_mean/2 # standard deviation of number of recruited individuals
age_imp_rec = TRUE # Takes the complimentary of the age fraction to reduce recruitment mean according to size (larger = closer to 1)
MR_rec_adj = -0.08

  # Disturbance parameters (ranges from super small to big impacts)
dist_imp = T # Turn on and off disturbance presence
disturbance_age_struct_type = "complex" # Impact value flat or varied by age [complex/flat]
#dist_probability = 0.1 # Probability of disturbance occurring (exponential function transformation)
dist_impact = 5 # Level of impact (multiplier)
dist_age_impact = 10 # Impact of age on disturbance 1/(1 + exp((age-val) / 10))
 

  ## Simulation parameters
time_max = 5000 # how long to run sim for
output_timept = time_max/5 # How often to report visual statistics
timepoint_pop_grab = c(750:1250)
#timepoint_pop_grab = c(seq(from=2, to=15), seq(from=40, to=45)) # Saves population at the end of the timepoints (post-recruitment + mortality events) - note time will be +1 than indicated as it is past incident events - saved in object pop_timepoints (list of lists)
