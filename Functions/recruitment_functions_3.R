## Function - Recruitment - density dependent recruitment

## Inputs
# pop - Population
# recruitment_age - age to maturity
# recruitment_constant - chance of recruitment (1 = recruits, 0 = none)
# population_min_size - Increased fecundity due to disturbance

# MR_togg - Turn on and off the Myrtle rust affect
# MR_recruit_impact_val - impact of Myrtle rust susceptibility on recruitment (multiplier)

# Note: MR is recruited based on parent pheno using beta distribution. To visualise parent MR pheno of 1-4: for (i in 0:4){hist(rbeta(n=4000, shape1=i+1, shape2 = 3)) }
