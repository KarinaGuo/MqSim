## Function - Mortality death rate with late intro

## Inputs
# pop - Population
# population_capacity - Maximum population size until 'comp' is used as punishment ðŸ”¨

# age_impact_val - impact of age ond eath (multiplier)
# mortality_age_shiftch - at what age does increases in age increase chance of death

# comp_togg - Turn on and off the competition  affect
# comp_impact_val - impact of competion on death (multiplier)

# MR_togg - Turn on and off the Myrtle rust affect
# MR_death_impact_val - impact of Myrtle rust susceptibility on death (multiplier)
# MR_age_impact_val - scaled impact of age on MR inflicted death increase
